## Architecture

You can find the architecture documentation, following the [arc42 standard](https://docs.arc42.org/home/), in the [architecture](architecture/00_table_of_contents.md) directory.

Diagrams are created using gaphor (`pip install gaphor`). The gaphor source file is in `architecture/images`.
