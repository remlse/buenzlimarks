# Testing Policy

1. When something's broken that could've been prevented by a test, we amend this testing policy document[^1].
1. We don't do any testing.

[^1]: The purpose of this approach is to avoid unnecessary testing that slows the development down, decreases fun and doesn't provide any benefit. By making mistakes and feeling the concequences, we will be able to learn much better what good testing and its benefits actually are.
