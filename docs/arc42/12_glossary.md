  <tr>
    <td>REST API</td>
    <td>
      A now mostly meaningless term in my opinion.
      The current industry standard for HTTP-based web app APIs is described as RESTful.
      Some properties of REST APIs are well-defined.
      For example, every request must be stateless, i.e. not depend on other requests.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Frontend & backend</td>
    <td>
      Terms used in web development, used to refer to the physically separated parts of a web app.
      "Frontend" refers to everything that's happening on the user's device.
      The classic technologies in this space are HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript.
      "Backend" refers to everything that's happening on the server.
      This usually includes a database and an api providing relevant business logic, written in basically any language.
